        ">3. Средние величины: среднее - 49.07, медиана - 28.34. Медиана меньше среднего, вероятно, в связи с тем, что среднее чувствительно к выбром и в данном случае смещается вправо из-за больших чисел.\n",

        ">5. \"Ящик с усами\" показывает, что по признаку 'gross_earn' существует много выбросов. По гистограмме видно, что эти выбросы находятся на достаточно большом расстоянии от среднего, что подтверждают и минимальное и максимальное значения, 90 процентиль. Тем не менее часть выбросов в районе от около 180 до 400 расположена достаточно плотно, поэтому это могут быть не выбросы, а редкие фильмы с достаточно высоким доходом. Таким образом, по результатам графического анализа становится понятно, что необходимо исключение выбросов, однако стоит внимательно отнестить к выбросам в области значений от 180 до 400."

        ">2. Нулевых значений нет. Нет необходимости в предобработке.\n",
        ">3. Средние величины: среднее - 110.26, медиана - 106. Медиана меньше среднего, вероятно, в связи с тем, что среднее чувствительно к выбросам и в данном случае смещается вправо из-за больших чисел.\n",
        ">4. 10-й процентиль - 89 - 10% фильмов не превышают 89 минут. 25-й процентиль - 96. 50-й процентиль - 106 - он же медиана, 50% фильмов не превышают 106 минут. 75-й процентиль - 120. 90-й процентиль - 135 - говорит о том, что бОльшая часть выборки находится до 135 минут, в то время как максимальное значение - 366, что говорит о возможном наличии выбросов.\n",
        ">5. \"Ящик с усами\" показывает, что по признаку 'runtime' выбросы присутствуют в пределах до примерно 60 минут и от 150 до 366, однако в пределах от 150 до 250 минут точки расположены плотно друг к другу и это также могут быть редкие фильмы, длинные по продолжительности. Фильмы, продолжнительностью более 250 минут представить сложно, поэтому, вероятно, все значения выше 250 являются выбросами. По гистограмме видно, что бОльшая часть значений (между 10 и 90 процентилем) находится в диапазоне от 75 до 145. Таким образом, по результатам графического анализа становится понятно, что выбросы есть и в меньшую и в большую сторону, поэтому в дальнейшем, скорее всего, необходимо будет их исключить."

У всех топ-5 режиссеров разные пропорции топ-5 классов фильмов: отличается и набор классов фильмов и их процентное соотношение. Трудно проследить взаимосвязь, однако среди всех классов можно выделить наиболее часто встречающиеся и занимающие бОльшую долю круговых диаграмм: 15 и 12А (ранее во время неграфического анализа категориальных данных уже было отмечено, что это наиболее часто встречающиеся значения признака).\n",

        "**Выводы:**\n",
        ">1. Трудно проследить четкую зависимость рейтинга фильма (rating) от кинорежиссера (director). У всех топ-5 режиссеров разные пропорции топ-5 рейтингов фильмов: отличается и набор рейтингов фильмов и их процентное соотношение. Однако можно отметить, что фильмы топ-5 режиссеров наиболее часто получают оценки в диапазоне от 6.0 до 8.5.\n",
        ">2. Рассматривая особенности распределения признака в разрезе основного признака, можно отметить, что фильмы Woody Allen чаще всего получают оценки от 6.3 до 7.7, фильмы Clint Eastwood - от 6.5 до 8.1, что выше, чем у Woody Allen, Steven Spielberg - от 7.2 до 8.2, что даже выше, чем у Clint Eastwood, Alfred Hitchcock - от 7.4 до 8.5, соответственно, еще больше, чем Steven Spielberg. Отличается только Ridley Scott с наибольшей разницей между минимальной и максимальной оценками - от 6.0 до 8.5. При этом процентное соотношение этих оценок у каждого режиссера примерно делится на равные части: так, например, 3 наиболее популярные оценки у Woody Allen занимают по 22.2%, а последующие 2 - по 16.7%, соответственно."

        ">1. Трудно проследить четкую зависимость рейтинга фильма (rating) от его класса (certificate). У всех топ-5 классов разные пропорции топ-5 рейтингов фильмов: отличается и набор рейтингов фильмов и их процентное соотношение. Однако можно отметить, что фильмы топ-5 режиссеров наиболее часто получают оценки в диапазоне от 6.1 до 7.5, разница между этими значениями невелика и  моно говорить о том. что фильмы топ-5 рейтингов в основном не получают ни очень низких, ни очень высоких оценок.\n",
        ">2. Рассматривая особенности распределения признака в разрезе основного признака, можно отметить, что  фильмы с классом 12А чаще всего получают оценки - от 5.8 до 7.1, фильмы класса 15 - от 6.4 до 7.3, что выше, чем у 12А, фильмы с классом PG - от 6.5 до 7.4, что больше, чем у 15, фильмы с классом 18 - от 6.2 до 7.5 и фильмы с классом U - от 6.6 до 7.5. При этом процентное соотношение этих оценок у каждого класса примерно делится на равные части по 20-18%.\n"

Фильмы 12A, PG, 12 и A классов приносят доход, в большинстве случаев не превышающий 100M. Наиболее высокодоходным классом можно назвать U, фильмы этого класса приносят доход свыше 100M, медиана - 56.7M.\n",

Таким образом, мы можем говорить о том, что взаимосвязь между признаками присутсвует, однако заметна только при сравнении всех возможных рейтингов между собой. В разрезе рейтингов от 6.1 до 7.5 взаимосвязи нет, поэтому, вероятно, и на других небольших интервалах ее не будет.\n",
